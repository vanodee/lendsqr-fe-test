## Usage
### Mock API
Demo user data was generated using [json-generator.com](https://www.json-generator.com/) and hosted on [mocky.io](https://www.mocky.io/). This data is fetched dynamically using React Router's `loader` functions.

### Navigation
- The `/` route renders the **Login Page**.
- Upon successful login, the app redirects to the **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin`), defaulting to the **Users Page** (`/admin/users`).
- Clicking on a user navigates to their **Details Page** (`/admin/users/:customer_number`).

---

## Development Process
1. **Design Analysis**:  
   - Studied the Figma design for typography, colors, shadows, spacing, and dimensions.
   - Created a mini style guide for consistent implementation.

2. **Setup**:  
   - Initialized the project with **Vite** and configured React, TypeScript, and SCSS.  
   - Installed **React Router** for routing and **vite-plugin-svgr** for SVGs.

3. **Page Development**:  
   - Built the Login Page with mock authentication logic and responsive design.  
   - Developed the Admin Layout, including the header, side navigation, and content area.  
   - Implemented the Users Page with data fetching, pagination, and filtering.  
   - Created the Single User Page with dynamic rendering and a tier display system.

4. **Final Touches**:  
   - Ensured responsiveness using SCSS breakpoint mixins.  
   - Added a 404 Page for unmatched routes.  
   - Deployed the project on **Vercel**.
